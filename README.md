Welcome to my temporary page. My new year's resolution for 2019 is to start blogging and to learn web development. I started both in 2018, but had the most success with the web development piece. I am still working on the blogging bit. 

So I am going to work on changing my web-hosting provider, but in the meantime, I'm also going to work on my web-development here on this page. 

So stay tuned. More to come I hope.
